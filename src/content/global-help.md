## Project Vision & Core Mission

**Project Vision:** I created this comprehensive driver security research platform to address critical gaps in existing driver analysis tools. This database goes beyond simple cataloging to provide advanced filtering, behavioral analysis, and HVCI compatibility verification for Windows drivers used in real-world attack campaigns.

**Core Mission:** Enable security researchers, threat hunters, malware analysts, and system administrators to efficiently identify, analyze, and defend against driver-based attacks through sophisticated search and filtering capabilities that weren&apos;t available in existing solutions.

## Features

**Advanced Behavioral Analysis:** Unlike static driver lists, this platform analyzes imported functions to automatically detect capabilities like memory manipulation, process killing, debug bypass, registry manipulation, and file system access.

**Real-time HVCI Verification:** Implemented proper HVCI compatibility checking that directly queries Microsoft&apos;s official vulnerable driver blocklist, providing more accurate results than local static lists used by other tools.

**Intelligent Search & Filtering:** Quickly search and filter drivers by attributes including hashes, company names, descriptions, HVCI compatibility, certificate status, architecture, and behavioral patterns.

**Certificate Analysis:** Comprehensive certificate validation system that categorizes drivers by trusted vs. unknown certificate authorities, helping assess legitimacy and risk levels.

**Architecture-Aware Filtering:** Filter by specific processor architectures (x64, x32, arm64) with clear visual indicators in driver cards for quick identification.

## Technical Implementation

**Automated Data Pipeline:** Continuous integration with the LOLDrivers project ensures up-to-date threat intelligence and newly discovered vulnerable drivers.

**Server-side Processing:** Advanced filtering and search operations are performed server-side for optimal performance with large datasets.

**GitHub Actions Integration:** Automated workflows fetch and parse Microsoft&apos;s vulnerable driver blocklist, ensuring HVCI compatibility data remains current.

**URL State Management:** Filter combinations and search queries are preserved in URLs, enabling collaboration and bookmarking of specific research queries.

**Responsive Design:** Optimized for security researchers working across different devices and screen sizes during investigations.

## Research

**Research:** Support cybersecurity research, threat intelligence development, and academic studies of driver-based attack vectors.

**Community Contribution:** Open-source approach encourages community contributions and collaborative security research efforts.

## Quick Reference - Key Terms

**HVCI:** Hypervisor-protected Code Integrity - Windows security feature that protects kernel code integrity using hypervisor technology.

**Process Killer Drivers:** Legitimate drivers with vulnerabilities that can be exploited to terminate processes with elevated privileges.

**Behavioral Analysis:** Automated detection of driver capabilities based on imported function analysis (memory manipulation, debug bypass, etc.).

**Architecture Display:** Quick visual indicators (x64, x32, arm64) shown next to driver titles for immediate architecture identification.

**Capacities Section:** Dedicated area in driver cards showing behavioral capabilities detected through function analysis.
